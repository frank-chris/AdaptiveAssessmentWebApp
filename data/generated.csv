0,"in 1774, louis xvi of the bourbon family of kings ascended the throne of france. he was 20 years old and married to the austrian princess marie antoinette. upon his accession the new king found an empty treasury. long years of war had drained the financial resources of france. added to this was the cost of maintaining an extravagant court at the immense palace of versailles. under louis xvi, france helped the thirteen american colonies to gain their independence from the common enemy, britain. the war added more than a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2 billion livres. lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge 10 per cent interest on loans. so the french government was obliged to spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments alone. to meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining an army, the court, running government offices or universities, the state was forced to increase taxes. yet even this measure would not have sufficed. french society in the eighteenth century was divided into three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.",[CLS] how did the the u. s. intervention in vietnam proved successful to the spread of education? explain.

1,"voting in the estates general in the past had been conducted according to the principle that each estate had one vote. this time too louis xvi was determined to continue the same practice. but members of the third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the assembly as a whole, where each member would have one vote. this was one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers like rousseau in his book the social contract. when the king rejected this proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly in protest.

2,"on the morning of 14 july 1789, the city of paris was in a state of alarm. the king had commanded troops to move into the city. rumours spread that he would soon order the army to open fire upon the citizens. some 7, 000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and decided to form a peoples ’ militia. they broke into a number of government buildings in search of arms. finally, a group of several hundred people marched towards the eastern part of the city and stormed the fortress - prison, the bastille, where they hoped to find hoarded ammunition. in the armed fight that followed, the commander of the bastille was killed and the prisoners released – though there were only seven of them. yet the bastille was hated by all, because it stood for the despotic power of the king. the fortress was demolished and its stone fragments were sold in the markets to all those who wished to keep a souvenir of its destruction.

4,"the indian landmass has a central location between the east and the west asia. india is a southward extension of the asian continent. the trans indian ocean routes, which connect the countries of europe in the west and the countries of east asia, provide a strategic central location to india. note that the deccan peninsula protrudes into the indian ocean, thus helping india to establish close contact with west asia, africa and europe from the western coast and with southeast and east asia from the eastern coast. no other country has a long coastline on the indian ocean as india has and indeed, it is india ’ s eminent position in the indian ocean, which justifies the naming of an ocean after it.

5,"india ’ s contacts with the world have continued through ages but her relationships through the land routes are much older than her maritime contacts. the various passes across the mountains in the north have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans restricted such interaction for a long time. these routes have contributed in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. the ideas of the upanishads and the ramayana, the stories of panchtantra, the indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of the world. the spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from india to different countries. on the other hand, the influence of greek sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from west asia can be seen in different parts of our country.

6,"at the centre of the discussion on poverty is usually the concept of the “ poverty line ”. a common method used to measure poverty is based on the income or consumption levels. a person is considered poor if his or her income or consumption level falls below a given “ minimum level ” necessary to fulfill the basic needs. what is necessary to satisfy the basic needs is different at different times and in different countries. therefore, poverty line may vary with time and place. each country uses an imaginary line that is considered appropriate for its existing level of development and its accepted minimum social norms. for example, a person not having a car in the united states may be considered poor. in india, owning of a car is still considered a luxury.
